      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>At Charity QR, we're revolutionizing the way fundraisers collect donations door-to-door. Our mission is to make charitable giving easier, safer, and more efficient for both fundraisers and donors.</p>
      <p>We've replaced traditional cash donations with a simple, secure QR code system. This innovative approach allows fundraisers to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collect donations quickly and securely</li>
        <li>Eliminate the risks associated with handling cash</li>
        <li>Provide donors with instant digital receipts</li>
        <li>Track donations in real-time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By leveraging technology, we're not just making fundraising safer - we're making it more effective. Fundraisers can focus on what really matters: connecting with donors and supporting their causes.</p>
      <p>Join us in embracing the future of charitable giving. With Charity QR, every door-to-door campaign becomes an opportunity to make a bigger impact, more safely and efficiently than ever before.</p>
